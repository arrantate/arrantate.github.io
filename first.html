    <h1>Flask Static Blog</h1>
    <h1>Why flask?</h1>
<p>To mark the start of this blog I thought it might be a good idea to explain how I got to this point.  I wanted to be able to launch a blog quickly in the most simply way that I could without using any of the usual tools like wordpress of blogger.  After doing some research I came across <code>flask_flatpages</code> and <code>flask_frozen</code> and set to work.</p>
<p><code>flask_flatpages</code> allows us to write our blog posts in .md files, allowing us to focus on the content rather than html tags, while</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up the Flask application</li>
<li>Using flask_flatpages to generate our blog posts</li>
<li>Using flask_frozen to generate static html files</li>
<li>Deploying using git</li>
<li>Hosting on github.io</li>
<li>Setting up a custom domain (i used godaddy.com)</li>
<li>Registering the site with <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>Setting up the flask application</h1>
<p>As always I start with setting up a new virtual environment for my project</p>
<pre><code>cd projects
mkdir blog
cd blog
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
</code></pre>
<p>Followed by installing the dependencies that I know I'll need using <code>pip install</code></p>
<pre><code>pip install flask flask_flatpages flask_frozen
</code></pre>
<p>That's it.  Now we have everything we need to get started.</p>
<p>Now in a new file <code>app.py</code> we need some boilerplate flask code.  Mine is slightly different to the one on the flask quickstart guide but I'll explain why.</p>
<pre><code>from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code> statement is there to allow us to easily run the development server from the console using the command <code>python app.py</code>.  It's not essential but it just makes life easier.  And since we are going to be generating a static site using this flask app, we dont need to worry about having debug set to true as we will not be deplying the flask app it's self.</p>
<p>So to test that this works just start up the development server with <code>python run.py</code> and open the url that is given to us in the console, something like http://127.0.0.1:5000/. We should see a blank webpage with just the words "Hello, World!" at the top.  If we do, everything worked and we have a working flask app.  But it doesn't do much yet, so let's get to the meaty bits.</p>
<p>more coming soon...</p>
