# [arrantate.co.uk](https://arrantate.co.uk/)

This is a page to show off some projects and websites created by me.  It's written as a simple static page with HTML5, custom CSS using SASS, and some javascript to spice it up.

Alogn with the landing page, some simple vanilla javascript pages will also be hosted on this website, which have their own sub directories within this repo.
